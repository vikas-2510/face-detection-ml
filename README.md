# face-detection-ml

Face detection is a fundamental computer vision task that involves identifying and locating human faces within images. This report presents a simple implementation of face detection using the OpenCV library in Python. The goal is to detect faces in images using a pre-trained model provided by OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier.
